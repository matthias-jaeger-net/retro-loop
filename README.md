> A text-based adventure gane where you play as an employee of a global corporation.

Story and game development by ChatGpt <chat.openai.com> and Matthias JÃ¤ger.

## Next round:

-   Establish player object with HEALTH and INVENTORY
-   Establish conditional branching in story, based on player object state

## Ideas:

-   Different sounds based on scene
-   Multiple branches in the story
-   Generative images, drawings or other graphical assets
-   Start screen that sells the game at first sight
